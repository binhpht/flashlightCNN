 We proposes  the  learning-based  denoising  methodcalled  FlashLight  convolutional  neural  network  (CNN)  or  Flash-Light  CNN  that  implements  deep  neural  networks  for  image  de-noising.  The proposed approach is based on deep convolution andinception  networks  that  are  employed  to  exploit  the  learning  capacity  of  training  very  deep  neural  networks  for  image  Gaussian denoising  problems.   The  quantitative  and  visual  performance  ofproposed  method  are  also  evaluated  and  compared  with  standardand current state of the art method
